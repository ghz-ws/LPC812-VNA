# LPC812-VNA
Cheap 4-port VNA unit with LPC812 and AD8302.
It needs external signal generator of https://github.com/ghz-ws/LPC1114-4chSG-AD9910
Python code is a software frontpanel script.
PCB is available from https://ghz-ws.booth.pm/items/4933667
Dynamic range of AD8302 is not enough. So that this VNA is not practical one.
